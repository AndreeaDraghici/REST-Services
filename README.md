### REST Services

-------

Dummy Project that handles API calls which contains methods to make calls to the REST service using HttpClient to make
GET, POST, PUT, etc. requests.

Test with an existing REST service by using a test REST service to get data and display it in the console.
JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is a good service for this.

Parses and processes responses using JSON serialization/deserialization libraries to transform incoming data into a
usable format in Java
